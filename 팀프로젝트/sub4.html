          >Woody has always been confident about his place in the world and that
          his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that’s Andy or Bonnie.
          <br />
          But when Bonnie adds a reluctant new toy called “Forky” to her room, a
          road trip adventure alongside old and new friends will show Woody how
          big the world can be for a toy.

          <span>
            Woody is the same pull-string cowboy sheriff that Andy fell in love
            with years ago.
            <br />
            He’s found a new home with Bonnie and her toys, and he’ll do
            anything to make sure she’s happy and they’re all taken care of.
            <br />But an unexpected reunion with his dear friend Bo Peep shows
            Woody that the world is much bigger than he ever imagined.

          <h1>Buzz Lightyear</h1>
          <span>
            Buzz Lightyear is loyal not only to his owner, but to the friends
            he’s made along the way—especially his once-rival Woody who’s like a
            brother to the ace Space Ranger these days.
            <br />Buzz would do anything to support his pull-string buddy, but
            when his efforts land him in a carnival game booth as an inadvertent
            prize, he turns to his inner voice for guidance.

            >Forky is not a toy! At least that’s what he thinks. <br />An actual
            spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure that he doesn’t
            belong in Bonnie’s room. <br />Unfortunately, every time he tries to
            get away, someone yanks him back into an adventure he’d rather skip.

          <h1>Bo Peep</h1>
          <span>
            Bo Peep is a long-lost friend of Woody, Buzz and the gang, who
            always shared a special connection with Woody while residing with
            her sheep on a lamp base at Andy’s house.
            <br />After being separated for years, Bo has become chipped and
            discarded, but her spirit is far from broken. <br />She has grown
            into an adventure-seeking free spirit whose strength and sarcasm
            belie her delicate porcelain exterior. <br />When she and Woody are
            reunited under unlikely circumstances, Bo realizes just how much
            she’s missed him, and can’t wait to show him what she’s been up to.

            1950s. <br />But unfortunately for her, a manufacturing defect in
            her pull-string voice box has left her sounding anything but
            adorable. <br />She has spent more than 60 years forgotten in the
            depths of a jam-packed antique store—her only companions are a band
            of voiceless ventriloquist dummies. <br />Gabby Gabby knows someone
            will want her if only she can find a working voice box to repair
            hers.

            <br />But when their plans are rudely interrupted, they find
            themselves on an unexpected adventure with a group of toys who have
            no idea what it feels like to be tacked to a prize wall.

          <h1>Duke Caboom</h1>
          <span
            >Duke Caboom is a 1970s toy based on Canada’s greatest stuntman.
            <br />Riding his powerful Caboom stunt-cycle, Duke is always
            prepared to show off his stunt poses with confidence and swagger.
            <br />However, Woody learns quickly that Duke has an Achilles heel:
            He has never been able to do the awesome stunts advertised in his
            own toy commercial. <br />For years, Duke has been sitting in an
            antique store, constantly reliving the failures of his tragic past.
